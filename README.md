# Reddit Client Project

This project was created as part of my profile buliding projects on Codecademy. The overview of this project was to build a React Application using the Reddit JSON API. I created a simple application that allows users to quickly search their favourite subreddits. The Reddit JSON API provides the information that is needed by the application.

Within this application I used a new method to style the project. I used CSS :root Selector. This allowed me to write all the styles in the top style sheet. You can then acces the styles using CSS variables var(). I liked this method because it allows you style different elements using the same variable function.

I found some aspects of this project to be easier than other aspects of the projects. I found it hard to hook up my application with the Reddit JSON API. I found a work around in order to hook the API with my appplication. I found it easier to build the different features and components of the application. In order to improve I will need to find different ways in order to hook an API with my React applications. The root selector styling and the way you can search all subreddits from one location makes my application standout. 

## How to install and run the project?

In order to view the project you will need to fork the repository to your GitHub profile. Once you have the repository you can clone the project. This will allow you access to the code base. This can be opened in your preferred code editor. Please note that this project was created using Visual Studio Code. Once the repository is opened in your preferred editor you can run npm install to install the dependencies to run the application. 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
